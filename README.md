# AudioChef

AudioChef is an automation tool for sound engineers. It is meant to be used for standard actions that are performed regularly and on many files. 

AudioChef allows the user to define a preset and apply it quickly by choosing it, drag-n-dropping files into the application and executing the preset on all of the files.

### Features

AudioChef supports a number of features:
* File format changes
* File name changes (Find-replace or wildcards)
* Applying an arbitrary number of standard sound transformations
* Saving and naming a combination of file format changed, file name changes and transformations for repeated use
* Loading only a part of a preset by locking specific changes in place
* Specifying a preset to be loaded automatically when AudioChef is started
* Changing AudioChef's defaults for transformation parameters


### Planned Features
* Loading VST3 plugins and saving them in AudioChef
