# AudioChef

AudioChef is an automation tool for sound engineers. It is meant to be used for standard actions that are performed regularly and on many files. 

AudioChef allows the user to define a preset and apply it quickly by choosing it, drag-n-dropping files into the application and executing the preset on all of the files.

AudioChef supports a number of features:
* File format changes
* File name changes (Find-replace or wildcards)
* Applying an arbitrary number of standard sound transformations

// TODO:
